# This pipeline gets triggered manually or via an API call.  
# It is a general purpose automation that allows you to export a solution from a Dataverse environment and commit it to a git branch.
# It facilitates:
# -Ensuring user can be part of the commit (instead of a generic user), thereby enabling tracking of who made what changes
# -Reuse for any solution in any Dataverse environment

# The following variables need to be set when the pipeline is queued to run:
# Project: The name of the Azure DevOps Project to which we are exporting our solution.
# Repo: The name of the Azure DevOps Repo to which we are exporting our solution.
# Branch: The name of the Azure DevOps Branch in the Repo above to which we are exporting our solution.
# CommitMessage: The commit message for this commit.
# Email: The email of the user performing the commit.
# ServiceConnection: The name of the service connection to Power Platform from which we'll be pulling the solution.
# SolutionName: The name of the solution being exported (i.e. Not the Display Name).
# UserName: The Display name of the user performing the commit.
